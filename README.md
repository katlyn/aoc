# Advent of Code
This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code. All current year
solutions are templated after `template.mjs`, and puzzle inputs are located in
the `inputs` directory.

# Running Solutions
Install dependencies with `npm i`. You can run the current year's solution with
`npm run solve`, or any specific day's solution with `node path/to/solution.mjs`.
